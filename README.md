CISPA Website Blackout Page
===========================

The HTML code in this repository was created for sites who wish to participate in the April 22nd
site blackout in protest of the passage of CISPA by the US House of Representitives. The code contains
no Javascript or other scripting code and will run in all browsers and on all web servers.

To install the script, simply copy the code to your web server and either replace the index.html page
(which may be index.php, index.py, or something similar) with this page or redirect your websites main
page to blackout.html. Be sure to look at the code and change my email address at the bottom to yours
so, if your visitors want to contact you about the blackout, they can. If you don't change the email
address and I receive email from your visitors, they may go unanswered.

Got questions? Contact me!

I welcome your emails in regards to this script or anything else. Feel free to drop me a line at
papillion@gmail.com. I also welcome improvements to this script. It was thrown together in a few
minutes and could most certainly be much better. Don't be shy, contribute!
